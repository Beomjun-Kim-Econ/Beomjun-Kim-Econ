## 🧪 Credit Risk Prediction & Data Leakage Analysis · [Presentation (KO)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z9__440qEtHpcwM_USZb8urkWqzhLxYj/view?usp=sharing)

- **Description**  
  A research-focused project on credit risk prediction using real-world tabular data, with an emphasis on identifying, categorizing, and empirically validating different forms of data leakage in machine learning pipelines.

  Beyond conventional train–test leakage in tabular data, the project extends the analysis to semantic data leakage in natural language processing, demonstrating how meaning-level similarity between samples can inflate evaluation performance.

- **Tech Stack**  
  - Statistical Machine Learning  
  - CatBoost, Logistic Regression, Linear SVM  
  - Sentence-BERT embeddings  
  - FAISS (HNSW) for scalable similarity search  

- **Role & Contribution**  
  - Proposed the core research idea of semantic data leakage beyond exact-duplicate leakage  
  - Designed and conducted experiments to detect leakage using cosine similarity between sentence embeddings  
  - Built an experimental pipeline combining Sentence-BERT and FAISS to identify semantically overlapping train–test samples  
  - Analyzed performance degradation after leakage-aware data filtering, highlighting robustness and reproducibility issues
